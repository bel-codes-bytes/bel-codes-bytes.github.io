        This is my first post on my blog. I decided in 2025 I want to maintain a
        blog to detail what I'm learning, any hobbies I'm taking up, and just
        generally keep up with my life. I have a few blog posts planned, but for
        now I'm just saying hi, and setting up my new site! Stay tuned for more
        :)
